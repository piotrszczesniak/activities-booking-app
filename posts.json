Schindler was an excellent entrepre-neur who made the declining factory prosper. At that time, Krakow was under German occupation what for the local population meant big problems. Jews were gathered in ghettos and used as cheap labor, to be exterminated a few years later in the camps in Auschwitz and Birkenau. Schindler mainly produced dishes, but also small military equipment for the German army. Al-though he was on the side of the occupant, but he didn&#8217;t remain indifferent to the fate of his Je-wish workers. He didn&#8217;t force them to slave labor, but he hired them to get them out of Nazi hell. Thanks to Schindler, over 1,000 people who were on his list survived. These events and Schindler&#8217;s heroism became the inspiration for Steven Spilberg to make the Schindler&#8217;s List &#8211; the film awarded with the Oscar, the Golden Globe and the BAFTA Award.

      "rendered": "<h2>Introduction: Bubble Football in Krakow</h2>\n<p>Are you looking for a unique and exciting activity that combines the thrill of sports with the hilarity of bouncing around in a giant inflatable bubble? Look no further than Bubble Football in Krakow! This adrenaline-pumping experience is perfect for people of all ages and fitness levels, making it an ideal choice for your next event or outing. In this article, we&#8217;ll explore the world of Bubble Football and discover why Krakow is the perfect location for this unforgettable adventure.</p>\n<h2>The Thrill of Bubble Football</h2>\n<p>Bubble Football, also known as Bumper Ball or Zorb Football, is a hilarious twist on the traditional game of soccer. Participants wear large, transparent inflatable bubbles that cover their upper body, leaving only their legs free to run, kick, and maneuver around the field. The objective of the game remains the same as regular soccer: score goals against the opposing team. However, the added element of the inflatable bubbles introduces a whole new level of fun and excitement.</p>\n<p>As players bump into each other, they bounce and roll around the field, often resulting in fits of laughter from both participants and spectators. The unpredictable nature of the game keeps everyone on their toes, as even the most skilled soccer players will find themselves challenged by the added element of the bubbles. The thrill of Bubble Football lies in its perfect blend of friendly competition and pure, unadulterated fun.</p>\n<h2>Bubble Football in Krakow: The Perfect Addition to Any Event</h2>\n<p>Bubble Football is an incredibly versatile activity, making it suitable for a wide range of events and occasions. Here are just a few examples of how Bubble Football can enhance your next event in Krakow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Birthday Parties: Looking for a unique way to celebrate a birthday? Bubble Football is a fantastic option that will leave guests talking about the party for years to come. With its high-energy gameplay and hilarious moments, Bubble Football is sure to be a hit with partygoers of all ages.</li>\n<li>Team Building: Companies and organizations can benefit from incorporating Bubble Football into their team-building events. The game encourages teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, as players must work together to score goals while navigating the challenges of the inflatable bubbles. Plus, the shared laughter and excitement of the game can help to break down barriers and foster camaraderie among colleagues.</li>\n<li>Family Outings: Bubble Football is an excellent choice for families looking for a fun and engaging activity that everyone can enjoy. The game is suitable for players of all ages and fitness levels, making it an inclusive experience that can bring families closer together.</li>\n<li>Stag and Hen Parties: For those planning a stag or hen party in Krakow, Bubble Football offers a unique and memorable experience that will have everyone laughing and bonding in no time.

The inflatable bubbles provide a protective barrier that cushions players from impacts, reducing the risk of injury. Additionally, the game is typically played on a soft surface, such as grass or artificial turf, to further minimize the potential for harm.</p>\n<p>Bubble Football is designed to be accessible to a wide range of players, regardless of age or fitness level. The game can be easily adapted to accommodate different skill levels and abilities, ensuring that everyone can participate and enjoy the experience.

Finally, we get back to business after the lockdown, hope there won&#8217;t be the second wave of coronavirus and everything will get back to normal. Sure thing that we respect all security measures like protective masks, disinfection or individual knee pads for each player. As usual, we provide door to door transfers with English-speaking drivers. All you need to do is to book an activity with us, come to Krakow, wait in front of the hotel or any other convenient place for you at the given time and relish playing bubble football game 🙂</p>\n<p>Our instructors are well-trained and ready for holding events for you. Standardly, every single event starts with a short, about 15-minute warm-up with our lady trainer. After that, you will be instructed on how to use bumper balls safely.</p>\n<p>Once you get through warm-up and briefing, the bubble football world is open for you. The game starts with bubble football which is the flag game and ending with bubble sumo, last one standing and VIP that are perfect for stag parties and team building events. Our events take place at the most modern sports halls which are located in almost every part of Krakow. For sure you will be tired after the event but totally loaded positive vibes and endorphins.

All you need to do is to wear bumper ball and smash your friend playing bubble football or a few more games scenarios like team bubble sumo, last one standing or VIP game which is perfect for stag parties &#8211; think you are strong enough to protect the groom so the opposite team doesn’t knock him down? As it’s quite physical activity, we provide refreshment drinks and water. If you politely ask, there is a chance that you will also get beers after the game. </p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://bumperball.test/experiences/quad-biking-krakow/\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><b>🥈 Quad Biking for the </b><span style=\"font-size: 20.16px;\"><b>Adventurous</b></span></span></a></h3>\n<p>Another activity that is very suitable for teams is quad biking. Driving quads through the forest, hills and streams is quite challenging but for sure makes your day. After driving, as an option, you can have so-called sausage offer. It means the package comprised of sausages, bread, mustard and ketchup and of course something to drink. You can choose from water, juice or we guess the most likable beverage, beer.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://bumperball.test/experiences/go-karting-krakow/\"><strong>🥉 Go-Karting Follows the Best</strong></a></h3>\n<p>Go-karting is still one of the most popular activities for stag and hen parties. We do it in a tournament mode. You have a training session, qualifications and two races. Who’s the fastest wins a cup. Optionally we can order you pizza or any other food you like as there is a canteen.</p>\n<h3>🚲 <strong>The Peleton is Just Few Steps Behind </strong></h3>\n<p>We can also speak a bit about extreme shooting with <a href=\"http://bumperball.test/experiences/shooting-range-krakow/\">Kalashnikov AK-47</a> or <a href=\"http://bumperball.test/experiences/paintball-krakow/\">paintball</a> as we do it as well but we think it’s rather comprehensive subject so we introduce you to shooting and paintballing packages in the next blog.
